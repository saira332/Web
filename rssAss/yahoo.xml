The president declined to shake anyone’s hand or even sit for the meeting Democrats scheduled at the White House on Wednesday to discuss a bipartisan solution to the nation’s failing infrastructure. He then cut the meeting short and staged a seemingly last-minute appearance at the White House Rode Garden, where he tore into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging “in a cover up” over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr Trump reportedly told Democrats in the five-minute meeting that he would like to work on infrastructure but would not negotiate with them until the probes had reached their conclusions — before walking out of the room. “So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country,” the president posted in a series of tweets following his appearance in the Rose Garden. “They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40m and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America, or get back to work.”The president went on to claim Democrats “really want a do-over” on the special counsel’s investigation, adding, “you can’t investigate and legislate simultaneously — it just doesn’t work that way.” “You can’t go down two tracks at the same time,” Mr Trump wrote. The president appeared particularly infuriated by Ms Pelosi’s comments from earlier in the day, in which the California Democrat said, “We do believe that it is important to follow the facts, we believe that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States, and we believe the president of the United States is engaged in a cover up, in a cover up.&amp;quot;&amp;gt; So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country. They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America, or get back to work....&amp;gt; &amp;gt; — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &amp;gt; &amp;gt; May 22, 2019Mr Trump responded by lambasting the House speaker over talk of possible impeachment proceedings, saying at his press appearance, “All of a sudden I hear last night they&amp;#39;re going to have a meeting right before this meeting to talk about the I word. The I word. Can you imagine?&amp;quot;“I don’t do cover ups,” he continued. New York Democrat Chuck Schumer and Ms Pelosi held a competing press conference of their own on Wednesday after the meeting, with the Senate minority leader telling reporters, “What happened in the White House would make your jaw drop.” The bizarre day arrived amid a slate of new subpoenas being issued by committees probing the president’s possible obstruction of justice outlined in the special counsel’s report. Hope Hicks, who served as Mr Trump’s former White House communications director, was issued a subpoena earlier this week, along with the former chief of staff to Donald McGahn, who served as the ex-White House counsel under Mr Trump. Mr McGahn defied a subpoena this week and failed to show up for a Congressional hearing after being ordered by Mr Trump not to comply with requests from the Democrats. At least 25 Democrats reportedly support impeachment proceedings against the president, including several committee chairs and members of Ms Pelosi’s leadership team, The Hill reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/trump-explodes-white-house-meeting-181510411.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 14:15:10 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.independent.co.uk/">The Independent</source><guid isPermaLink="false">trump-explodes-white-house-meeting-181510411.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j3jDDpoXSiz7Rpl_XvFBug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9d987c6bdf4f2e204d657220cee116d4" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-explodes-white-house-meeting-181510411.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j3jDDpoXSiz7Rpl_XvFBug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9d987c6bdf4f2e204d657220cee116d4" width="130" height="86" alt="Trump explodes in White House meeting, refusing to work with Democrats and lashing out on Twitter" align="left" title="Trump explodes in White House meeting, refusing to work with Democrats and lashing out on Twitter" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Donald Trump has lashed out at Democratic leadership after refusing to sit for a bipartisan meeting at the White House, claiming he will no longer work with the party until all investigations against him have been closed.

Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersDemocrats grabbed control of the House of Representatives in January of this year determined to restore congressional oversight. But with the Trump administration now at a moment of reckoning, a battle royal has unfolded. What exactly is the White House doing?The Trump administration’s strategy is simple: block any and all requests from Democrats in Congress, even if it means defying a subpoena, such as blocking compliance by former White House counsel Don McGahn, a key witness in the Mueller inquiry, to testify on Capitol Hill this week.Also this month, the attorney general, William Barr, has ignored a subpoena for the full report by Robert Mueller on his Trump-Russia investigation and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin rebuffed a House request to hand over six years’ of Trump’s tax returns. Trump, who has dismissed the congressional inquiries as “presidential harassment”, suggested the Democratic chairs of House committees instead turn their powers to investigating his former political opponent Hillary Clinton.&amp;gt; Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility. Jerry Nadler, Schiff, would have a whole new future open to them. Perhaps they could even run for President!&amp;gt; &amp;gt; — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2019The White House strategy appears designed either to force Democrats to take the administration to court – which could take years – or pull the trigger on impeachment. What can Democrats actually do?Democrats on the House judiciary committee have voted to hold Barr in contempt and have threatened to hold McGahn in contempt, too.The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, said the chamber may consolidate multiple contempt citations against officials. Some Democrats cite the House’s “inherent contempt” powers, which grant them the right to jail individuals in the Capitol – an action that hasn’t been taken since the 1930s – or issue fines.Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, suggested US officials held in contempt of Congress be fined $25,000 a day.“We’re looking through the history and studying the law to make sure we’re on solid ground,” Schiff told Axios in a recent interview.Others see the third branch of US government, the judicial branch, as the answer.“The only recourse is litigation, which the president will likely lose, but it will cause delay,” said Greg Brower, a former assistant director in the FBI’s office of congressional affairs.The White House could drag court action out beyond the 2020 election. Is impeachment really in the cards?The heart of the debate among Democrats is whether or not to begin impeachment proceedings.Some rank-and-file lawmakers have already embraced the idea, stating the 11 instances outlined in Mueller’s report in which Trump or his campaign sought to obstruct justice are reason enough alone.But Democratic leaders are treading cautiously, because they would never win a conviction in the Republican-led Senate.The American public is split on the issue , with polls showing a majority against it and support for the idea falling even among Democrats.Justin Amash, a representative from Michigan, just became the first Republican to call for impeaching Trump, an important bipartisan point that drew widespread backlash for him.And Jerry Nadler, Democratic chair of the powerful House judiciary committee, signaled impatience on Tuesday, after McGahn was a no-show to testify.“We will not allow the president to stop this investigation, and nothing in these unjustified and unjustifiable legal attacks will stop us from pressing forward with our work on behalf of the American people,” Nadler said.“We will hold this president accountable, one way or the other.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/contempt-impeachment-trump-democrats-locked-060018141.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 02:00:18 -0400</pubDate><source url="https://www.theguardian.com/international">The Guardian</source><guid isPermaLink="false">contempt-impeachment-trump-democrats-locked-060018141.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FeaXk6n4aNQ3eZIGSKEJWA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/65b2d3f5b485f09680aad8853bc507ca" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/contempt-impeachment-trump-democrats-locked-060018141.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FeaXk6n4aNQ3eZIGSKEJWA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/65b2d3f5b485f09680aad8853bc507ca" width="130" height="86" alt="Contempt or impeachment?

It&amp;#39;s locked into its current orientation, with a permanent nearside and farside, but it wasn&amp;#39;t until the Apollo missions that scientists were able to see just how different the two sides really are. The nearside, with its sea of dark gray basins standing in contrast to the brilliant white powder that covers the rest of its face, varies dramatically from the farside, which is marked with countless smaller craters in a more uniform distribution.The debate over how the Moon&amp;#39;s split personalities developed has raged for decades, but new research seems to indicate that one of the possible explanations does indeed hold water. The theory, that Earth&amp;#39;s Moon was struck by a tiny dwarf planet long ago, is the subject of a new research paper published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.Using computer models to simulate what may have happened to the Moon&amp;#39;s surface long ago, researchers suggest the most likely scenario seems to be the collision between the Moon and a very large body. The impact of a dwarf planet as large as 480 miles across would have struck what we see today as the Moon&amp;#39;s nearside at a speed of 14,000 miles per hour.This theory stands in contrast to other proposed explanations, including the theory that Earth may have once had not one Moon, but two. The two-moon theory suggests that Earth&amp;#39;s moon duo may have at one point collided and merged, leaving the Moon as we see it today looking oddly unsymmetrical.The dwarf planet collision scenario assumes that whatever the body that struck the Moon was, it was in its own path around the Sun and just happened to be in the right place at the right time to strike Earth&amp;#39;s natural satellite. This, the researchers say, would also explain why the crust on the farside of the Moon is different than that of its nearside.&amp;quot;We demonstrate that a large body slowly impacting the nearside of the Moon can reproduce the observed crustal thickness asymmetry and form both the farside highlands and the nearside lowlands,&amp;quot; the paper explains. &amp;quot;Additionally, the model shows that the resulting impact ejecta would cover the primordial anorthositic crust to form a two‐layer crust on the farside, as observed.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/researchers-tiny-planet-slammed-moon-191132900.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 15:11:32 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.bgr.com/">BGR News</source><guid isPermaLink="false">researchers-tiny-planet-slammed-moon-191132900.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dh.45zgRAbhqay68B2B2jQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.news.bgr.com/2c47cab5eac22483a1ea0ca2243c63fa" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/researchers-tiny-planet-slammed-moon-191132900.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dh.45zgRAbhqay68B2B2jQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.news.bgr.com/2c47cab5eac22483a1ea0ca2243c63fa" width="130" height="86" alt="Researchers say a tiny planet slammed into the Moon a long time ago" align="left" title="Researchers say a tiny planet slammed into the Moon a long time ago" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Earth&amp;#39;s Moon only ever shows us one face.

This, the researchers say, would also explain why the crust on the farside of the Moon is different than that of its nearside.&amp;quot;We demonstrate that a large body slowly impacting the nearside of the Moon can reproduce the observed crustal thickness asymmetry and form both the farside highlands and the nearside lowlands,&amp;quot; the paper explains. &amp;quot;Additionally, the model shows that the resulting impact ejecta would cover the primordial anorthositic crust to form a two‐layer crust on the farside, as observed.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>Don&amp;#39;t Just Vacation in Any Old Airbnb When You Can Choose One on Wheels</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/dont-just-vacation-old-airbnb-162500714.html"&gt;&lt;img src="" width="130" height="86" alt="Don&amp;#39;t Just Vacation in Any Old Airbnb When You Can Choose One on Wheels" align="left" title="Don&amp;#39;t Just Vacation in Any Old Airbnb When You Can Choose One on Wheels" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/dont-just-vacation-old-airbnb-162500714.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 12:25:00 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.caranddriver.com/">Car and Driver</source><guid isPermaLink="false">dont-just-vacation-old-airbnb-162500714.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/dont-just-vacation-old-airbnb-162500714.html"&gt;&lt;img src="" width="130" height="86" alt="Don&amp;#39;t Just Vacation in Any Old Airbnb When You Can Choose One on Wheels" align="left" title="Don&amp;#39;t Just Vacation in Any Old Airbnb When You Can Choose One on Wheels" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>US stocks rally on Huawei reprieve as pound gyrates on Brexit news</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/huawei-trade-war-weigh-asian-markets-024842999--finance.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kJHFKgmHZ6de4.ec.5wfrg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/79e8239fc6e0b5611b2aea778a31ed790e950be2.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="US stocks rally on Huawei reprieve as pound gyrates on Brexit news" align="left" title="US stocks rally on Huawei reprieve as pound gyrates on Brexit news" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Global stocks rallied Tuesday as the United States took a step away from imposing crushing restrictions on Chinese telecom company Huawei, while the pound gyrated on fresh Brexit drama.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/huawei-trade-war-weigh-asian-markets-024842999--finance.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 20:37:34 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.afp.com/">AFP</source><guid isPermaLink="false">huawei-trade-war-weigh-asian-markets-024842999--finance.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kJHFKgmHZ6de4.ec.5wfrg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/79e8239fc6e0b5611b2aea778a31ed790e950be2.jpg" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/huawei-trade-war-weigh-asian-markets-024842999--finance.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kJHFKgmHZ6de4.ec.5wfrg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/79e8239fc6e0b5611b2aea778a31ed790e950be2.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="US stocks rally on Huawei reprieve as pound gyrates on Brexit news" align="left" title="US stocks rally on Huawei reprieve as pound gyrates on Brexit news" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Global stocks rallied Tuesday as the United States took a step away from imposing crushing restrictions on Chinese telecom company Huawei, while the pound gyrated on fresh Brexit drama.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>Google changes policy to block misleading ads for anti-abortion groups</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/google-changes-policy-block-misleading-232846281.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.96kJDuQf71O8AR7VXrlbg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9593931e43b84e0a01599392965077f4" width="130" height="86" alt="Google changes policy to block misleading ads for anti-abortion groups" align="left" title="Google changes policy to block misleading ads for anti-abortion groups" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Announcement comes after Guardian revealed Google gave $150,000 in free ads to opaque anti-abortion groupBeginning in June, Google advertisers will be required to be certified. The company has recently faced scrutiny for providing advertising to an organization that sought to deter women from getting abortions. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesGoogle has changed its advertising policy after facing scrutiny for providing tens of thousands of dollars in free advertising to an anti-abortion group that runs misleading ads designed to deter women from terminating their pregnancies.Google announced this week that starting in June, advertisers running ads “using keywords related to getting an abortion” will first have to distinguish themselves as an organization that “either provides abortions or does not provide abortions”, according to the new policy update.The policy change comes after the Guardian revealed the Obria Group ran ads suggesting it provides abortion services at its medical clinics, but actually sought to deter “abortion-minded women” from terminating their pregnancies.Obria runs a network of clinics known as crisis pregnancy centers across the US that provide some prenatal treatment, such as pregnancy tests, ultrasounds and counseling, but also seek to deter women from seeking abortions and do not offer referrals for alternative treatment.Obria was awarded a $120,000 Google advertising grant in 2015, according to a public filing. In 2011, it received nearly $32,000.The report led to pressure from lawmakers in Washington, who denounced the “intentional misinformation campaigns” of organizations such as the Obria Group.Carolyn Maloney, a senior Democratic congresswoman from New York, said in a letter sent to Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, that she was “appalled” by the report in the Guardian that Google awarded $150,000 in free advertising to the Obria Group, which Maloney said had a history of falsely advertising medical services to women.“Google should in no way be subsidizing any misinformation campaigns, especially campaigns designed to deceive women about their own reproductive care options,” Maloney said in her letter to Pichai.“Your continued support of Obria Group’s intentional misinformation campaigns denies women access to truthful information about their medical choices,” she added.The letter was jointly signed with Suzanne Bonamici, a Democratic congresswoman from Oregon.Google had already come under pressure in the past for running advertisements that appear to violate its own policies against misrepresentation in advertising, yet the company continued to publish ads for clinics that seem to offer abortion services but are actually opposed to terminations and try to dissuade women from seeking them out.Pro-choice groups have welcomed the policy change. “Fake women’s health centers have a well-documented history of using lies and deception to push medically inaccurate information and prevent women from accessing essential healthcare,” said Adrienne Kimmell, vice president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. “People turn to the internet for information at vulnerable moments in their lives, and it’s important that women are able to trust Google for access to accurate and safe information, not deceptive websites and advertisements that hide their true ideology and agenda.”According to the new Google policy, advertisers must get certified by submitting an application that requires basic information about the organization.“Depending on how you’re certified, Google will automatically generate one of the following in-ad disclosures for your abortion product or service ads: ‘Provides abortions’ or ‘Does not provide abortions’,” the new policy reads.“The disclosures will show on all search ad formats.

Accuses DHS Secretary of Choosing to Let Migrant Kids Die: ‘This Is Intentional’" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Representative Lauren Underwood (D., Ill.) on Wednesday accused the acting Department of Homeland Security secretary of intentionally implementing border-security policies that would lead to the deaths of migrant children.During his appearance before the House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan was asked to explain why five children have died in federal custody after being apprehended at the southern border since December.“These stories are appalling and yet they keep happening,” Underwood said, referring to the recent migrants deaths, as well as reports of inadequate housing and medical care for migrant children apprehended at the border. “Now Congress just provided half a billion dollars in February to address the humanitarian crisis at the border and will soon provide more. Why do these tragedies keep happening?”McAleenan, who succeeded Kirstjen Nielsen in April, responded that the resources provided by Congress are insufficient to address the record number of asylum seekers, many of whom are women and children, arriving at the border each day.“They&amp;#39;re happening because the crisis is exceeding the resources provided. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve asked for more and we&amp;#39;ve asked for more authority to prevent this crisis from happening in the first place and to prevent the children from being placed at risk,” he said.Underwood, a 32-year-old freshman lawmaker, dismissed McAleenan&amp;#39;s claims, suggesting instead that he was implementing policies intended to result in the death of children.“People keep dying, sir. People keep dying. So, this is obviously more than a question of resources,” she said. “Congress has been more than willing to provide the resources and work with you to address the security and humanitarian concerns, but at this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like — and the evidence is really clear — that this is intentional. It&amp;#39;s a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration and it&amp;#39;s cruel and inhumane.&amp;quot;“That&amp;#39;s an appalling accusation and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,” McAleenan responded.&amp;gt; The acting DHS secretary denies the accusation that migrant deaths are &amp;quot;intentional&amp;quot; policy. pic.twitter.com/7xiThg8IVY&amp;gt; &amp;gt; -- VICE News (@vicenews) May 22, 2019Republicans on the panel reacted forcefully to Underwood&amp;#39;s assertion.

The vote passed 9-7.“You cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children. That is completely inappropriate and her words should be taken down,” Rogers said during the hearing. “She was very explicit.”“It’s absolutely disheartening to see some radical Democrats stoop so low to say that the Acting DHS Secretary McAleenan is murdering children. McAleenan left the private sector to serve his country after the towers fell on 9/11. This is a sad day for America and the Democrat party,” Representative Mark Green (R., Tenn.) said in a statement provided to National Review.On Monday, 16-year-old Carlos Hernandez Vasquez became the fifth migrant child to die in federal custody in the last six months.Vasquez crossed into the U.S. without his parents and died of the flu at a Border Patrol station in Weslaco, Texas after spending a week in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CPB). His death has drawn scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers, who have pointed out that policy dictates he should have been transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) within 72 hours of his apprehension.“Make no mistake: This is a pattern of death. This is an epidemic of death by the Trump administration,” Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas told reporters during a press conference Tuesday. “As I mentioned, nobody had died for ten years. And in the last six months, you&amp;#39;ve had five deaths.”The Trump administration has for months urged Congress to provide resources for medical care and the construction of housing units that can accommodate the new asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border. The existing detention centers lack the capacity to handle the record influx and were built to accommodate the mostly single men who formerly comprised most of the illegal-migrant population.The administration has also urged Congress to reform the asylum system through legislation in order to limit the number of migrants who must be detained on U.S. soil while their claims are being adjudicated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/dem-rep-accuses-dhs-secretary-164853639.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 12:48:53 -0400</pubDate><source url="https://www.nationalreview.com/">National Review</source><guid isPermaLink="false">dem-rep-accuses-dhs-secretary-164853639.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v8nnDO.0ytB_DMyKmE5EpQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/47dc0bc885035948910ae29e96c7627f" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/dem-rep-accuses-dhs-secretary-164853639.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v8nnDO.0ytB_DMyKmE5EpQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/47dc0bc885035948910ae29e96c7627f" width="130" height="86" alt="Dem.

While Alabama’s near-total abortion ban stipulates up to 99 year prison sentences for doctors performing abortions, Allred said, “The truth is, the victims are the women and the girls who have to get a back-alley abortion and who are going to be left to die.” The women’s rights lawyer told the crowd in Foley Square that she’d seen firsthand what it was like for women who had no access to abortion in the 1960s. After being raped at gunpoint in Mexico, she said, she traveled back to the United States, found out she was pregnant, and discovered that it was a crime in many states for doctors to perform abortions. “I had to get a back-alley abortion in a bathtub from a person who was not licensed, they were just doing it for the money,” she said. Once she began hemorrhaging, she said, the person who performed the procedure told her it was “[her] problem now.” Allred recalled suffering from a 106-degree fever and being packed in ice once she was hospitalized, all while she was surrounded by other women who were “suffering” from illegal abortions. “The only time a hospital would admit a woman like me was if she was bleeding to death from an abortion,” she said. But even then, she said she was vilified for having gotten the procedure done. “The nurse told me, ‘This should teach you a lesson,’” Allred said. “It taught me abortion should be safe, legal, and accessible!” New Laws in Georgia and Alabama Have Women Panicking They Can’t Get AbortionsAllred told the crowd of demonstrators that women under the jurisdiction of the new anti-abortion laws in Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia will also likely have to turn to back-alley abortions as a means of terminating their pregnancies, claiming the laws will force women into “no-win situations.”“More women died from illegal abortions than men in Vietnam,” Allred said. “Most of these lawmakers signing these bills will never have to get an abortion.”New York mayor and 2020 contender Bill de Blasio also spoke at the rally, describing the lawmakers passing the bills as “right-wing extremists” ignoring the American majority and trying to take the U.S. back to a time of equality “disparity.”“The only person who gets to decide is the woman herself. That is what the American people believe,” de Blasio said. “Women will die because these laws were passed, and that shouldn’t happen in our America… The rights of women are what matter most.”Earlier this month, Alabama’s Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill that would punish doctors for performing abortions with a maximum sentence of 99 years. The law outlaws abortion in all stages of pregnancy and makes no exception in cases of rape or incest. Missouri lawmakers also recently passed a bill that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and Georgia’s Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

height="86" alt="Trump administration considers blacklisting another major Chinese technology firm, further inflaming trade conflict" align="left" title="Trump administration considers blacklisting another major Chinese technology firm, further inflaming trade conflict" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Trump administration is considering blacklisting another major Chinese technology company in a move that would broaden a US campaign to sever China’s access to American know-how and inflame a deepening trade conflict, according to an individual familiar with the debate.Although no final decision has yet been reached, the administration is preparing to move against Hikvision, the world’s largest maker of video surveillance technology, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The deliberations were first reported by The New York Times.The disclosure comes less than a week after the administration barred US companies from supplying Huawei, perhaps China’s most prominent manufacturer, without first obtaining a US government license.The administration earlier this week relaxed the ban, saying it would grant temporary 90-day waivers for US companies to help Huawei maintain its existing networks.US officials are said to be eyeing the same penalty for Hikvision, using a Commerce Department mechanism known as the “entity list”.Citing national security considerations, the US congress last year banned federal agencies from purchasing equipment made by Hikvision and four other Chinese technology companies: Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Dahua.The measure was triggered by “classified information the committee reviewed in the course of our regular oversight activities”, according to Claude Chafin, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee.Hikvision supplies surveillance cameras that the Chinese government has deployed throughout the Muslim-majority Xinjiang region to combat what it describes as separatist terrorism.Randall Shriver, US assistant secretary of defence for Asia, said earlier this month that the Chinese government is detaining 3 million Uighur Muslims in re-education camps. The authorities in Beijing describe the facilities as vocational training centres.In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the United States, denied reports of human rights abuses.“They are real training centres,” he said. “They are not camps. They have open gates. There’s no armed guards. People could go home over weekend.”Hikvision last month reported earning about $1.65bn (£1.3bn) on revenue of roughly $7.2bn (£5.7bn) in 2018.In its annual shareholder letter, the company said it had faced numerous challenges last year but remained “upbeat about growth in the domestic and overseas markets in the years ahead”.The administration’s intensifying campaign to limit China’s access to advanced US technologies comes as a year-long trade conflict defies hopes of an early settlement.Despite the president’s continued pursuit of a trade deal, the administration has been cracking down on China in other realms.The Justice Department in December indicted two hackers who allegedly worked with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, targeting companies holding advanced technologies with military applications.The Commerce Department is drawing up new regulations to restrict US exports of 14 advanced technologies including robotics and quantum computing, in a move motivated by concern over China’s access to American innovations.Some Trump administration officials want to disconnect American investors and companies from Chinese companies that help beef up the Chinese military, “Big Brother” surveillance networks or those that benefit from China’s alleged theft of US trade secrets.Last year, the Commerce Department banned state-backed ZTE from doing business with American suppliers after the company violated the terms of an earlier enforcement action.But the president reversed the ban, which would have crippled ZTE, after a personal plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping.The episode illustrates that any move to sever Chinese companies’ links to the United States might cause collateral damage to the US economy.ZTE spends about $2.6bn (£2.05bn) annually buying products from US companies such as Qualcomm and Intel. Huawei also relies heavily on American suppliers.Administration officials recognise that the greater the number and significance of Chinese companies sanctioned, the greater the pain for US companies and their workers.The Washington Post&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/trump-administration-considers-blacklisting-another-101629736.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 06:16:29 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.independent.co.uk/">The Independent</source><guid isPermaLink="false">trump-administration-considers-blacklisting-another-101629736.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gLSrxGE6Cy33IFrezW8txA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/de6105790301ed022722f0383b8f942e" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-administration-considers-blacklisting-another-101629736.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gLSrxGE6Cy33IFrezW8txA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/de6105790301ed022722f0383b8f942e" width="130" height="86" alt="Trump administration considers blacklisting another major Chinese technology firm, further inflaming trade conflict" align="left" title="Trump administration considers blacklisting another major Chinese technology firm, further inflaming trade conflict" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Trump administration is considering blacklisting another major Chinese technology company in a move that would broaden a US campaign to sever China’s access to American know-how and inflame a deepening trade conflict, according to an individual familiar with the debate.Although no final decision has yet been reached, the administration is preparing to move against Hikvision, the world’s largest maker of video surveillance technology, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The deliberations were first reported by The New York Times.The disclosure comes less than a week after the administration barred US companies from supplying Huawei, perhaps China’s most prominent manufacturer, without first obtaining a US government license.The administration earlier this week relaxed the ban, saying it would grant temporary 90-day waivers for US companies to help Huawei maintain its existing networks.US officials are said to be eyeing the same penalty for Hikvision, using a Commerce Department mechanism known as the “entity list”.Citing national security considerations, the US congress last year banned federal agencies from purchasing equipment made by Hikvision and four other Chinese technology companies: Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Dahua.The measure was triggered by “classified information the committee reviewed in the course of our regular oversight activities”, according to Claude Chafin, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee.Hikvision supplies surveillance cameras that the Chinese government has deployed throughout the Muslim-majority Xinjiang region to combat what it describes as separatist terrorism.Randall Shriver, US assistant secretary of defence for Asia, said earlier this month that the Chinese government is detaining 3 million Uighur Muslims in re-education camps.

People could go home over weekend.”Hikvision last month reported earning about $1.65bn (£1.3bn) on revenue of roughly $7.2bn (£5.7bn) in 2018.In its annual shareholder letter, the company said it had faced numerous challenges last year but remained “upbeat about growth in the domestic and overseas markets in the years ahead”.The administration’s intensifying campaign to limit China’s access to advanced US technologies comes as a year-long trade conflict defies hopes of an early settlement.Despite the president’s continued pursuit of a trade deal, the administration has been cracking down on China in other realms.The Justice Department in December indicted two hackers who allegedly worked with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, targeting companies holding advanced technologies with military applications.The Commerce Department is drawing up new regulations to restrict US exports of 14 advanced technologies including robotics and quantum computing, in a move motivated by concern over China’s access to American innovations.Some Trump administration officials want to disconnect American investors and companies from Chinese companies that help beef up the Chinese military, “Big Brother” surveillance networks or those that benefit from China’s alleged theft of US trade secrets.Last year, the Commerce Department banned state-backed ZTE from doing business with American suppliers after the company violated the terms of an earlier enforcement action.But the president reversed the ban, which would have crippled ZTE, after a personal plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping.The episode illustrates that any move to sever Chinese companies’ links to the United States might cause collateral damage to the US economy.ZTE spends about $2.6bn (£2.05bn) annually buying products from US companies such as Qualcomm and Intel. Huawei also relies heavily on American suppliers.Administration officials recognise that the greater the number and significance of Chinese companies sanctioned, the greater the pain for US companies and their workers.The Washington Post&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>1967 Ford Mustang Fastback Restoration Is A Work Of Art</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/1967-ford-mustang-fastback-restoration-103820809.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/updBcivyc8IP9z5uUt0WVQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/autoclassics_668/4dc4fb7faee75d8aa235425762831417" width="130" height="86" alt="1967 Ford Mustang Fastback Restoration Is A Work Of Art" align="left" title="1967 Ford Mustang Fastback Restoration Is A Work Of Art" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Ford Mustang is an American automotive icon known the world over.

Sanders, running second in most polls, tweeted that there was “no ‘middle ground’ when it comes to climate policy”.If and when Ocasio-Cortez does endorse a candidate, Sanders probably remains the favourite to secure her support.

But the investigation into the theft led police to someone in the online Disney fandom: a Disney blogger who taunted Disney about their security, posted conspiracy theories about Buzzy’s disappearance and, in the final days before his arrest, uploaded a picture of the robot’s decapitated and eyeball-less head.Patrick Spikes, 24, was arrested last week. He worked at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, until last year. But Spikes didn’t completely part ways with the theme park after he stopped working there. Instead, he started churning out videos, podcasts, and tweets under the username “BackDoorDisney.” His Twitter account, which amassed more than 17,000 followers before going dark last week, promised to give fans an inside view of Disney World. In its seven months of operation, the account uploaded pictures of Disney control rooms, secret maps, and Disney cast members pretending to have sex while dressed as characters from Toy Story.Soon, Spikes was posting about an even more salacious Disney World story. In August, Disney told police that someone had stolen clothes off Buzzy. The 300-pound animatronic child used to sit inside the “Cranium Command” exhibit, in Epcot’s Wonders of Life Pavilion. But the building, which hosted somewhat dated attractions, had been closed for years. The stolen clothes (including a miniature bomber jacket) were worth nearly $7,000, Disney claimed, according to an affidavit from Florida’s Orange County Sheriff’s Department. Later, the entire robot was stolen, an operation that required the thief to cut through electric cables.Spikes and other Disney bloggers posted about Buzzy’s rumored disappearance. But Spikes and a crowd of Disney fans who broke into the park soon came under suspicion. Spikes routinely boasted of secret trips through Disney World, including with a friend who climbed the park’s Thunder Mountain roller coaster.“Good job filling the holes under the Mk back fence this morning,” Spikes wrote in a January tweet directed at Disney. “I told you guys about this issue 2 months ago but it took somebody going in and climbing one of your coasters for you to care.”On his personal Twitter account, Spikes taunted Disney, advising them to buy a bulk box of security cameras from Best Buy. As the search for Buzzy continued, Disney fans speculated that an urban explorer might have snatched the robot.Eventually, police began narrowing in on Spikes and his scene. Investigators found an October picture of Buzzy on Spikes’ @BackDoorDisney account. The picture does not appear to have been taken inside the Cranium Command exhibit. In texts with investigators, Spikes allegedly let slip that Buzzy’s clothes were sold on the black market for $8,000.Police got a warrant for Spikes’ cellphone and called him in for questioning in December. The meeting went poorly when Spikes tried to cut it short.“The defendant stated he felt sick and felt that he was going to vomit,” police alleged in an affidavit. “A short time later, he began to make strained breathing noises, and stated he couldn’t breath. He requested water, which was given to him, and also was allowed to lay on the floor. The fire department responded and all vitals were normal.” Spikes was taken to a hospital. Police charged him with non-violently resisting arrest. He has pleaded not guilty.Spikes later made a video about a police search on his house, and professed his innocence.“I said ‘really? The entire thing got stolen?’ I didn’t really believe it,” he said in the March video. “It blew my mind. I was like, you can’t be serious right now.”Later in the video, Spikes suggested that Disney had staged Buzzy’s disappearance in order to shut down his BackDoorDisney account.“There’s a theory someone talked about that Imagineering [a Disney team] removed Buzzy and didn’t tell anyone else. So when Operations, the part of the company that runs the Pavillion noticed he was missing, they filed him as ‘stolen,’” he said. “Did Disney willingly file a report, knowing the thing wasn’t stolen, just to run me down? Because obviously I had been posting a lot of backstage photos and stuff, and information … It almost seems like they wanted my phones because they knew I had a lot of backstage photos on them.”But BackDoorDisney kept implying inside knowledge of Buzzy’s disappearance.In a May 12 tweet, he tweeted a picture of Buzzy’s fate. The tweet showed a picture of Buzzy’s decapitated head, with its eyeballs scratched off. The image was included in a screenshot of a text Spikes received, which meant someone else might have stolen the robot.TwitterFive days later, police arrested Spikes. Although Buzzy’s disappearance featured prominently in an arrest affidavit (police appear to have started investigating him over Buzzy’s theft), Spikes was actually charged for a different series of alleged thefts from Disney World. His lawyer did not return The Daily Beast’s request for comment.In July, police alleged, Spikes printed a fake Disney employee card for his cousin and snuck him into the park. The pair allegedly snuck into the Haunted Mansion, a popular ride, and stole a collection of wigs and outfits from backstage. The clothes, which were designed for the ride’s animatronic ghosts, cost between $40 (a tiara) and $1,746 (a robot’s jacket), adding up to more than $7,000.Spikes and his cousin allegedly took pictures throughout the heist, and posed in the wigs at a nearby 7-Eleven. A video from shortly after the theft allegedly shows Spikes’ cousin’s girlfriend wearing a robot’s stolen dress.Disney may have priced the clothes at just over $7,000, but they allegedly went for four times that price on the black market. Days after the alleged burglary, Spikes allegedly received a combined $29,451 payment from two people over Paypal. One of the people, whose name is redacted in the affidavit, told police he paid Spikes $8,890 for 18 items from various Disney heists, including $1,000 for a Haunted Mansion dress.Shortly before his arrest, Spikes teased a forthcoming video about the black market for stolen Disney gear.Police haven’t charged Spikes with Buzzy’s disappearance. But they say his video about the raid on his house raised questions about his involvement. In the video, he showed part of a search warrant for his house. Police say he edited the document to remove references to two pieces of evidence police sought.“The fact that Spikes altered the warrant for his video and only removed these two items indicate that he was aware these items were used in a crime,” the affidavit reads.In that same video, Spikes tells viewers he’ll keep his lips tight about Buzzy’s disappearance until the investigation is over.“If things are still under investigation, I’m not going to get on YouTube and run my mouth about it,” he said. “That would be dumb.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

This can be as early as six weeks – at which point most women do not yet know they are pregnant. The bill imposes jail sentences for women found guilty of aborting or attempting to abort their pregnancies, with the potential for life imprisonment and the death penalty. It is not scheduled to come into effect until 1 January and is expected to face challenges in the courts – with it potentially being postponed. But anti-abortion activists hope challenges will lead to the US Supreme Court reversing Roe vs Wade – the landmark Supreme Court decision which legalised abortion nationwide in 1973 – especially with new conservative justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh sitting on the court.The Supreme Court has previously ruled that states cannot ban abortion before a foetus is viable – about 23 to 25 weeks.District prosecutors for Georgia’s four most populous counties – Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb and DeKalb – have said they would not, or could not, prosecute women under the controversial new law.“As District Attorney with charging discretion, I will not prosecute individuals pursuant to HB 481 [the heartbeat bill] given its ambiguity and constitutional concerns,” DeKalb County district attorney Sherry Boston told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.“As a woman and mother, I am concerned about the passage and attempted passage of laws such as this one in Georgia, Alabama, and other states.”She added: “There is no language outlined in HB 481 explicitly prohibiting a district attorney from bringing criminal charges against anyone and everyone involved in obtaining and performing what is otherwise currently a legal medical procedure”.According to the publication, the technical language of the bill means that district attorneys could potentially seek a murder charge against someone who breaches the heartbeat law.“As a matter of law (as opposed to politics) this office will not be prosecuting any women under the new law as long as I’m district attorney,” Gwinnett County DA Danny Porter said. He said he did not think it would be possible to prosecute a woman for either murder or unlawful abortion if she got an abortion after six weeks.John Melvin, acting District Attorney of Cobb County, echoed this position, saying women could “absolutely not” be prosecuted under the unlawful abortion statute.Fulton County district attorney Paul Howard “has no intention of ever prosecuting a woman under this new law&amp;quot;, a spokesperson said, adding that he also would not prosecute abortion providers.Georgia’s new bill does include exceptions for cases involving rape, incest, or in situations where the health of a mother is in danger.“Planned Parenthood will be suing the State of Georgia. We will fight this terrible bill because this is about our patients’ lives,” Dr Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said.Georgia’s bill comes after Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed a controversial abortion bill into law last week that is the most restrictive abortion bill in the US.Under the law, doctors would face 10 years in prison for attempting to terminate a pregnancy and 99 years for carrying out the procedure. The abortion ban, which has been branded a “death sentence for women”, would even criminalise performing abortions in cases of rape and incest. Ms Ivey said the new law might be “unenforceable” due to Roe v Wade but said the new law was passed with the aim of challenging that decision.Alabama state lawmakers compare abortions in America to the Holocaust and other modern genocides in the legislation – spurring Jewish activists and abortion rights groups to rebuke the bill as “deeply offensive.”Alabama’s new bill comes as politicians in several other states propose legislation to restrict abortion – with some 16 other states looking at new measures.More than a dozen other states have passed or are considering versions of Georgia’s law. Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio have also approved bans on abortion once a foetal heartbeat is detected. On Friday, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill banning abortions after eight weeks.Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia vowed to sue on the day the governor signed Georgia’s heartbeat bill. It has also fuelled many in the entertainment industry to threaten to boycott Georgia.“We’re putting lawmakers on notice: Your votes are far outside the mainstream, and we will now spend our time and energy launching a campaign to replace you,” Staci Fox, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, said at the time.A federal judge blocked a heartbeat bill in Kentucky which was scheduled to come into effect instantly as it could be unconstitutional, while Mississippi passed a six-week abortion law in March that is not due to come into force until July and is also facing challenges.Ohio passed a similarly restrictive law in 2016 which was vetoed by the governor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/abortion-ban-georgia-prosecutors-refuse-103754069.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 06:37:54 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.independent.co.uk/">The Independent</source><guid isPermaLink="false">abortion-ban-georgia-prosecutors-refuse-103754069.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w5CgQcPtVexpvDXzZ.Gvgg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/69a212b2fa29827c761a20310f504d83" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/abortion-ban-georgia-prosecutors-refuse-103754069.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w5CgQcPtVexpvDXzZ.Gvgg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/69a212b2fa29827c761a20310f504d83" width="130" height="86" alt="Abortion ban: Georgia prosecutors refuse to enforce &amp;#39;heartbeat&amp;#39; law" align="left" title="Abortion ban: Georgia prosecutors refuse to enforce &amp;#39;heartbeat&amp;#39; law" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;District lawyers in Georgia have announced they will not prosecute women for getting an abortion after the US state effectively banned the procedure.Georgia governor Brian Kemp signed the controversial “heartbeat” abortion ban into law earlier in the month – giving the southern state one of the most restrictive laws in the US.The legislation, which has provoked outrage among women’s rights groups, bans abortion once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo.

This shouldn&amp;#39;t come as much of a surprise since the original Pixel and Pixel XL phones were designed by Google in partnership with HTC. Once a market leader, HTC had already fallen quite far at that point, and it had just released its own iPhone 6 copycat in hopes of boosting sales. Google&amp;#39;s first-generation Pixel phones were based on the design of that iPhone 6 ripoff, which was called the HTC One A9s. The Pixel was basically an Android-powered iPhone 6, while the Pixel XL was an Android-powered iPhone 6 Plus. The only real difference in designs was the big glass panel the Pixel phones had on the back.Google&amp;#39;s current-generation Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL aren&amp;#39;t quite as blatant when it comes to copying Apple. Of course, the larger Pixel 3 XL still takes inspiration from Apple&amp;#39;s latest iPhone models and includes a big notch at the top of the display. If everything we&amp;#39;ve heard so far pans out, however, Google&amp;#39;s Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones will be nothing like Apple&amp;#39;s iPhone XS or the next-generation iPhone 11. Instead, they&amp;#39;ll take design cues from Samsung&amp;#39;s Galaxy S10 series -- and if the results end up looking anything like the renders you&amp;#39;re about to see in this post, there&amp;#39;s a very good chance that Google&amp;#39;s 2019 Pixel phones will look even better than the iPhone 11 series handsets Apple is planning to release later this year.Thanks to months worth of leaks and rumors, we know almost exactly what Apple&amp;#39;s iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Max, and iPhone 11R will look like when they&amp;#39;re announced this coming September. In a nutshell, the iPhone 11 is going to be a copy of the iPhone XS, but it&amp;#39;ll have a huge square camera bump on the back that houses Apple&amp;#39;s new triple-lens camera system. Here&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;ll look like when Apple unveils the iPhone 11 series in a few months:It doesn&amp;#39;t look bad, not by a long shot, but it also isn&amp;#39;t anything special. For the second time, Apple plans to use almost the same exact smartphone design for three straight years instead of two, just like the company did with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 7.In contrast to the iPhone 11 series phones set to debut in September, rumors suggest Google&amp;#39;s next-generation Pixel 4 lineup will feature a complete design overhaul. Google is said to have ditched the massive, unsightly bezels on its Pixel 3 phones in favor of an all-screen design with hole-punch cameras just like the Galaxy S10 from Samsung. In fact, the Pixel 4 will supposedly have one hole-punch selfie camera like the Galaxy S10 and S10e, while the larger Pixel 4 XL will apparently have dual selfie cameras in an oblong cutout, just like the Galaxy S10+.Graphic designer Jonas Daehnert, who goes by @PhoneDesigner on Twitter, has seen the same rumors as the rest of us. Unlike the rest of us, however, Daehnert has the chops to turn those rumors into reality by mocking up lifelike smartphone designs. He recently turned his attention to the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, and the results are absolutely stunning. Take a look:And here&amp;#39;s his vision of the Pixel 4 XL in white:There may end up being a few things here and there that are off the mark. For example, the latest rumor suggests that Google&amp;#39;s new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones won&amp;#39;t have any buttons on them at all. But for the most part, these renders are likely a very good indication of what we can expect from the real Pixel 4 series phones once Google releases them this coming October.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/impossibly-sleek-pixel-4-renders-121741802.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 08:17:41 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.bgr.com/">BGR News</source><guid isPermaLink="false">impossibly-sleek-pixel-4-renders-121741802.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oieYICDmBPk5Lag27PYzlQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.news.bgr.com/3b635ea2f5f953debfce0ecc4c50593b" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/impossibly-sleek-pixel-4-renders-121741802.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oieYICDmBPk5Lag27PYzlQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.news.bgr.com/3b635ea2f5f953debfce0ecc4c50593b" width="130" height="86" alt="These impossibly sleek Pixel 4 renders look so much better than the iPhone 11" align="left" title="These impossibly sleek Pixel 4 renders look so much better than the iPhone 11" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Pixel smartphone series began its life as a shameful iPhone copycat. This shouldn&amp;#39;t come as much of a surprise since the original Pixel and Pixel XL phones were designed by Google in partnership with HTC. Once a market leader, HTC had already fallen quite far at that point, and it had just released its own iPhone 6 copycat in hopes of boosting sales. Google&amp;#39;s first-generation Pixel phones were based on the design of that iPhone 6 ripoff, which was called the HTC One A9s. The Pixel was basically an Android-powered iPhone 6, while the Pixel XL was an Android-powered iPhone 6 Plus. The only real difference in designs was the big glass panel the Pixel phones had on the back.Google&amp;#39;s current-generation Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL aren&amp;#39;t quite as blatant when it comes to copying Apple. Of course, the larger Pixel 3 XL still takes inspiration from Apple&amp;#39;s latest iPhone models and includes a big notch at the top of the display. If everything we&amp;#39;ve heard so far pans out, however, Google&amp;#39;s Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones will be nothing like Apple&amp;#39;s iPhone XS or the next-generation iPhone 11. Instead, they&amp;#39;ll take design cues from Samsung&amp;#39;s Galaxy S10 series -- and if the results end up looking anything like the renders you&amp;#39;re about to see in this post, there&amp;#39;s a very good chance that Google&amp;#39;s 2019 Pixel phones will look even better than the iPhone 11 series handsets Apple is planning to release later this year.Thanks to months worth of leaks and rumors, we know almost exactly what Apple&amp;#39;s iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Max, and iPhone 11R will look like when they&amp;#39;re announced this coming September. In a nutshell, the iPhone 11 is going to be a copy of the iPhone XS, but it&amp;#39;ll have a huge square camera bump on the back that houses Apple&amp;#39;s new triple-lens camera system. Here&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;ll look like when Apple unveils the iPhone 11 series in a few months:It doesn&amp;#39;t look bad, not by a long shot, but it also isn&amp;#39;t anything special.
